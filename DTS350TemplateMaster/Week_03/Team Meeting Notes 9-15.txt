We went through the data transformation part of the assignment. 
-Chase found a library for the unit conversions.
-We discussed the NA and NaN results in the table, and the different ways we filtered the data to deal with them

Chase presented his case study.
    -What challenges did we encounter?
    -How do his results relate to the questions asked?

We discussed the upcoming project
    -The tasks seem to be increasingly open ended, which is cool.
