#Comments about R
#I learned that glimpse() shows all of the variables for a data set. 
#I also learned that the function kable() tells you what the abbreviations within
# a data set mean and its more reader friendly then glimpse()

ggplot(data = iris, aes(x= Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, shape = "diamond") 

#As the petal length gets larger does the petal width get larger as well?
#The answer to this question is yes. It is obvious that as the petal length grows,
#so does the petal width.
