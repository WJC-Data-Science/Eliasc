#Data Vis #1 - Percentage of non-RWB and RWB color schemes
https://pudding.cool/2020/08/campaign-colors/

The first thing I noticed about this graphic is the simplicity of it. Its very easy for the viewer to understand what the graph is talking about. It does this by using the same color throughout the graph. I like this is certain scenarios where its not necessary to distinguish between two differnt groups. I also like how they included the percentage of the non-RWB color schemes so you aren't just guessing the actual number. The one issue I have with the visualization is at the top the "Non-RWB colors" and "RWB colors" are in too light of a font color and maybe size. I say this becuase I didn't see it at first and took my a second to understand.

#Data Vis #2 - U.S. initial claims for unemployment insurance in 2020

This is a nice graphic for the overall cases of amount of claims filed for unemployment insurance in 2020. It's very easy to read the bars and has a nice flow to it. The issue I have with this graphic is that the data flows from one moneth to the next, so if you can' tell the amount of claims for one specific month.

#Data Vis #3 - Is Insurance More Expensive in Black Neighborhoods

This graph is very clean with not much text on it. It doesn't take long to understand what it is saying. It also makes it easy to know what population they did their reasearch on because it is right below the title. The issue I have with the graph is that they only have 4 buckets to include 100% of the population, and the buckets go from <1% to 1-5% to 5-20% to >20%. The 5-20% seems like a larges jump, especially when there isn't much of a difference between the average price of 1-5% and 5-20%.

#Data Vis #4 - The Most Negative Characters
https://pudding.cool/2017/08/the-office/

This is a very interesting graphic. It has a lot going on in it, but it is still pretty easy to understand, especially with the overall average. This is because their use of color makes it easy to distinguish. The issue I have with it is that its very busy and difficult to understand what consitutes negative behavior.
