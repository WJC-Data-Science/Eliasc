I learned how to import data from .csv and .xslv as well as how to label data inside a visualization. The thing I found most difficult was needing to know how to change the data type when necessary.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
download.file("https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/mlb-elo", "https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/mlb-api/mlb_elo.csv")

mlb_elo <- read_csv("https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/mlb-api/mlb_elo.csv")
mlb_elo

mlb_elo_kcr <- filter(mlb_elo, team1 == "KCR")

write_csv(mlb_elo_kcr, "KCRoyals_Home_Games.csv")

```
