In regards to having students knowing about the need to reduce pollution, the younger students and the older students have the most knowledge. I would recommend we focus on the age group from 7-16. The graph "Age_comparison" shows that their is a dip in the middle of the age grous and thats where we should put most of our resources into.

```{r}
head(Twelve, 10)

head(Older_than_twelve, 10)

Age_comparison
```
